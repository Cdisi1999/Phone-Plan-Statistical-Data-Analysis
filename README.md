# Megaline Plan Analysis

This repository contains a statistical data analysis project for Megaline, a telecom operator offering two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The goal of this analysis is to determine which plan generates more revenue and provide insights for optimizing advertising budgets.

## Project Overview

As an analyst, your task is to analyze the behavior of 500 clients and compare the revenue generated by the two prepaid plans. The analysis includes data preparation, customer behavior analysis, hypothesis testing, and overall conclusions based on the findings.

## Key Features

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Converted data into appropriate formats.
Identified and resolved data inconsistencies and errors.

### Customer Behavior Analysis:

Monthly aggregation of calls, texts, and internet usage.
Calculations of monthly revenue per user based on plan features.

### Statistical Analysis:

Computed descriptive statistics (mean, variance, standard deviation).
Plotted histograms for calls, texts, and data usage.

### Hypothesis Testing:

Tested whether the average revenue differs between the two plans.
Analyzed revenue differences by geographical region (NY-NJ vs. others).

## Project Steps

### 1. Open and Explore Data:

Data is sourced from five CSV files:
  megaline_calls.csv
  megaline_internet.csv
  megaline_messages.csv
  megaline_plans.csv
  megaline_users.csv
  
Data includes customer demographics, plan details, and monthly usage.

### 2. Prepare the Data:

Cleaned and reformatted data types.
Calculated monthly metrics for each user:
  Calls made and minutes used.
  Text messages sent.
  Volume of data used (in GB).
  Monthly revenue (accounting for plan limits and overage charges).
  
### 3. Analyze Customer Behavior:

Aggregated usage statistics for both plans.
Visualized data distributions and trends.

### 4. Test Hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis 1: No difference in average revenue between the Surf and Ultimate plans.
Null Hypothesis 2: No difference in average revenue between NY-NJ users and users from other regions.
Performed t-tests with significance levels to validate findings.

### 5. Draw Conclusions:

Summarized key insights and actionable recommendations.
